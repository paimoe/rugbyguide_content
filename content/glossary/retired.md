description: A definition of the term "Retired" in Rugby Union
links_from: retired
---

A player who no longer plays professional rugby. Often there will be a difference between "retired from internationals" and **retired**, where a player is not selected for Test matches but still plays club rugby.

This decision can be due to various reasons such as age, injury, or personal choice. Once retired, the player may choose to take on different roles within the sport, such as coaching, commentary, or administrative positions.
