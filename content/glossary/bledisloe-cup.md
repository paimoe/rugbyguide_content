The Bledisloe Cup is a trophy awarded in rugby union competition between the national teams of Australia and [New Zealand]({{< relref "teams/nzl" >}}). It is named after Lord Bledisloe, a former Governor-General of New Zealand, who donated the trophy in 1931. The competition is typically held annually and consists of a series of matches between the two teams. The number of matches can vary, but it is usually two or three games, and the team that wins the majority of these matches claims the cup.

The Bledisloe Cup is contested as part of the {{< glossary0 "Rugby Championship" >}}, which also includes teams from South Africa and Argentina. However, additional matches specifically for the Bledisloe Cup may be played outside of this tournament. The cup has significant historical and cultural importance in both countries, and it serves as a major event in the international rugby calendar. The team holding the cup at the end of the series retains it until the next series is contested.
