The term **Six Nations** refers to an annual rugby union competition involving six European countries: England, France, Ireland, Italy, Scotland, and Wales. The tournament is one of the oldest and most prestigious in the sport, with its origins dating back to 1883 when it was initially a competition between the Home Nations (England, Ireland, Scotland, and Wales). France joined in 1910, and Italy was added in 2000, expanding the competition to its current format.

Each team plays every other team once, resulting in a total of 15 matches over the course of the tournament. Points are awarded based on match outcomes, with the team accumulating the most points being declared the champion. The competition also includes several individual trophies contested between teams, such as the Calcutta Cup (England vs. Scotland) and the Millennium Trophy (England vs. Ireland). The Six Nations Championship serves as a key event in the international rugby calendar and is closely watched by rugby enthusiasts around the world.
