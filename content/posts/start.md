## What is Rugby Union?

Rugby Union is a team sport played between **two teams of 15 players**. The game has 40 minute halves for an **80 minute match**. Teams score in two ways: getting the ball to the other end of the field, called a **try**, or by kicking the ball through the posts.

Each team has 15 players, **8 forwards** and **7 backs**. Typically, forwards are bigger, and backs smaller and faster (though not always!). [What are the positions in a rugby team?]({{< relref "player-positions" >}})

> Rugby Union is not the same as Rugby League (similar sport but different). Rugby Sevens is a smaller, faster variant of Union and this guide would not apply. <!--[](/variants)-->

There are many parts to the game. Scrums, mauls, lineouts, kicks "taken back in", but most of these details are not important to *enjoying* the game for the first time. However, for a quick explanation:

- **Scrums** are used to restart play after a minor infringement. The forwards from each team bind together and push against each other. The ball is put in the middle and hooked backwards.
- **Rucks** happen after a tackle is made. Both teams try to secure the ball. Keep an eye on the halfback in each case to see who has gained control.
- **Lineouts** restart play after the ball goes out along the sideline. The forwards compete to secure a ball that is thrown down the middle.

## Objectives
Each team tries to get to the end of the field they are facing. **The team with the ball is attacking, and the other team is defending.**

The attacking team tries to move down the field towards the opposition goal line. **They can move forward by running, passing backwards, or kicking the ball.** They will try to maintain possession in most cases. [The ball can only be passed backwards]({{< relref "passing-backwards" >}}).

The defending team does not have the ball. They try to stop the attacking team by tackling, and also trying to steal the ball. The objective is to prevent the opposition from scoring a try. The defenders will also try to not concede territory, and also to gain possession in order to attack.

Generally, a team with more possession is more likely to win. A team with more territory is also more likely to win.

## What should you pay attention to?

There is a lot happening during play. If the ball is in play (being run, being passed), simply watch the ball carrier. The action will generally revolve around them.

If the ball is being kicked, pay attention to where the kick will land.

If the ball is in a ruck, **watch the attacking halfback (No. 9 or No. 20).** If they are reaching for the ball, the attacking team has secured the ball and will continue to attack. If the halfback is standing around waiting, they have likely lost the ball and the defending team has it.

It can be difficult to understand what happens in a ruck, so just consider if it is a **turnover** or if the attack will continue.

The scrum is a way of restarting play. The attacking team will try to start play from it, again, pay attention to the scrumhalf (No. 9) or the person at the back of the scrum (No. 8).

<!-- If both teams are near halfway, not much is happening. If a team is near the other end of the field, they are attacking well. The defenders must repel the attack. -->

> Key Takeaway: Try to follow the ball. On TV, the camera will usually focus on the ball carrier.

## How does a team score?
Placing the ball in the opponents goal area is worth 5 points, and called a **try**. The attacking team has a chance to kick an extra 2 points, called a **conversion**.

If a team infringes on the [laws of the game](/), the other team gets a penalty. If it is close enough, they may try to kick it through the posts for 3 points.

A player can perform a drop kick for 3 points, though this is uncommon.

## What is a good score?
Using past data, the [average Rugby World Cup score](https://blog.rugbybot.com/posts/average-rugby-world-cup-score/) is **38 - 13**. A score over 30 is very good, and a score under 10 would be quite low. 

### Score differences
- If difference is less than 10 points, it is close and either team could win. 
- If it is more than 10 points, the team in the lead has a good chance to win. 
- More than 20, it is likely the team in the lead will win.

Three points per 10 minutes of a match is a good scoring rate. If the teams are very different in skill level, this would be more.

The higher ranked team is **very** likely to win vs a lower ranked team.

Games in bad weather (rain, wind) average lower scores, with games in the sun, or under a closed roof, tending to have higher scores.

## Which team is doing better?

**Territory** is a good measure of which team is doing well. If you the defending team is right on their own line, they are under a lot of pressure and may concede points soon.

If the attacking team is not moving up the field, the defending team is doing better. The attacking team, over time, should gain territory steadily.

The **number of penalties** given by a team can show pressure. The more penalties given away, the more likely the other team will score. It can also lead to **yellow and red cards** being given.

## What about XYZ rule?
This guide is designed so that people can watch the game and enjoy the "pulse" of the game, rather than being able to determine which scrum penalty it was. More specific rule explanations will be on separate pages.

## Other guides
Other places have guides that may have more information. I have tried to keep this guide as minimal as possible.

## Conclusion

These things take time. If you are watching with someone, ask them any questions! 

Even after years of watching, I still find some of the decisions on the field confusing. Ask any fan what a particular scrum penalty was for, and you will get multiple answers.

Just remember to follow the ball, hope your team is going to the correct end of the field, and enjoy the game.
