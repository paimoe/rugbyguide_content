Each team plays each other team once. The most successful teams are England and Wales.

### The Rugby Championship

The Rugby Championship is an annual competition between four Southern Hemisphere teams: Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and Argentina (who joined in 2012).

New Zealand has been the most dominant team in its history, winning 20 out of the 28 editions.

## Club Competitions

Super Rugby is a Southern Hemisphere club competition. It started in 1996, and has had many different formats over the years. The current format (2023) has 12 teams from Australia, New Zealand and one Fijian team (the **Fijian Drua**).

## Other Competitions

### National Provincial Championship

This is New Zealand's domestic competition. Generally, the best players from this competition will be selected for Super Rugby teams, and for the All Blacks.

### Sevens World Series

Not specifically Rugby Union, but the Sevens World Series is a system of international tournaments across the world. The players in a Sevens team will generally not also play "full" rugby union (fifteen-a-side). At the end of the season, the team with the most championship points is the **World Series Champion**.

## Cups

Many **Cups** are played in international rugby. These are generally between two nations to add history to the matchup. For example, New Zealand and France contest the [Dave Gallaher Trophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Gallaher) while Australia and South Africa contest the [Mandela Challenge Plate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandela_Challenge_Plate).

### Bledisloe Cup

One of the most prominent Cups is the **Bledisloe Cup**, contested between New Zealand and Australia. It has been played 63 times (2023) and usually is a two or three match series each year.

New Zealand have won 51 out of the 63 occasions.

## Extras

### Matches between Club and International Teams

Occasionally, for either special occasions or as a warmup, international teams will play clubs. These events happened much more often before professionalism, where rugby teams had **tours** of other countries. These tours would involve 2 or 3 matches against that nation's international team, as well as 5+ matches against clubs from the country.

For a recent example, New Zealand played against **Munster** in 2008, while on tour in Ireland. New Zealand won 18-16.

### British and Irish Lions

The British and Irish Lions are a combined team of England, Wales, Scotland and Ireland. Every four years, starting in 1888, the BIL alternate touring New Zealand, Australia and South Africa. These are usually the most valuable events outside of the World Cup.

There has been 38 tours. The Lions have won 15, drawn 2 and lost 21. They have a winning record against Australia, a losing record against South Africa, and have only beaten New Zealand once.
