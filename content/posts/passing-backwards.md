In Rugby Union, the ball must be passed **backwards out of the hands**. The ball can travel forwards in an **absolute** manner, but must be passed backwards **relative to the players moving**.

## How do teams gain field position?

Teams can still run forward while passing. Even though the passes are backwards, a team can make progress. For example, running 5 metres forward and passing 1 metre backwards will gain them field position.

Teams can also kick to gain **territory**, but this will often give the opposition possession.

## What if a pass goes forwards?

This is a minor infringement. The other team will be awarded a {{< glossary0 Scrum >}}.
