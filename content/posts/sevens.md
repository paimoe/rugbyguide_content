Rugby Sevens, often simply called **Sevens**, is a fast-paced variant of Rugby Union that has captivated fans around the world, especially after its inclusion in the Olympics. Unlike the traditional 15-a-side rugby, Sevens is played with seven players on each team, leading to more open play, faster action, and often higher-scoring games. This guide will introduce you to the world of Rugby Sevens, its history, top teams, and what competitions to keep an eye on.

## History

Rugby Sevens originated in the Scottish borders town of Melrose in 1883, when a local butcher named Ned Haig came up with the idea as a way to raise funds for his club, Melrose RFC. The first-ever Rugby Sevens tournament was held that same year, and it quickly gained popularity due to its fast-paced and exciting nature. The simplicity of the games, shorter duration, and fewer players made it more accessible and easier to organize, which helped it spread to other parts of the United Kingdom and eventually around the world.

By the mid-20th century, Rugby Sevens had gained a foothold in countries like [New Zealand]({{< relref "teams/nzl" >}}), Fiji, South Africa, and England, where it became a staple at local festivals and rugby clubs. The sport's profile grew significantly with the establishment of the [Hong Kong Sevens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong_Sevens) tournament in 1976, attracting international teams and fans from around the world. The event's success demonstrated the global appeal of Rugby Sevens, leading to the formation of the Sevens World Series in 1999, with [New Zealand]({{< relref "teams/nzl" >}}) taking out the inaugural event.

## What are the differences between Rugby Union and Rugby Sevens?

While Rugby Sevens and traditional rugby union (15s) share the same basic rules, there are several key differences between the two formats:

### Number of Players
The most obvious difference is the number of players on the field. Sevens is played with seven players per side, compared to 15 in traditional rugby union. This creates more space on the field and encourages keeping the ball in hand, versus kicking for territory.

### Match Duration
Sevens matches are much shorter than traditional rugby games. A standard Sevens game consists of two halves of seven minutes each, with a one-minute halftime break, much shorter than the traditional 80-minute game. This means that entire tournaments can be played in a single day or weekend, creating the festival atmosphere often associated with Sevens events.

### Pace and Style of Play
Due to the fewer number of players and shorter match duration, Rugby Sevens is significantly faster-paced. Players must have exceptional fitness levels, speed, and endurance. The game places a higher emphasis on individual skills, such as speed, passing, and tackling, with set pieces like scrums and lineouts used as a quick way to restart play, instead of a contest.

### Scoring
While the scoring system in Sevens remains the same as in 15s (five points for a try, two points for a conversion, and three points for a penalty or drop goal), the open nature of the game often leads to higher scores and more tries, which can make it more spectator-friendly.

### Tactics
The strategy in Sevens is vastly different from 15s. With more open space, teams focus on creating and exploiting overlaps, using passing and running lines to break through defenses. This contrasts with the more structured, territory-based approach often seen in 15s.

## Sevens World Series

The Sevens World Series, established in 1999, is an annual circuit of international Sevens tournaments featuring the world's best teams. The series is made up of multiple tournaments held in different countries, with teams accumulating points based on their performance at each event. Previously, at the end of the season, the team with the most points is crowned the World Sevens Series champion. Since 2023-2024, the overall Series champion is crowned as the winner of the final tournament only.

The World Series is a major event in the Rugby Sevens calendar, providing teams with regular competition and fans with a chance to see their favourite players in action throughout the year. Some of the most famous tournaments in the series include the Hong Kong Sevens, Dubai Sevens, and the London Sevens, each offering a unique blend of high-quality rugby and a festive atmosphere.

## Sevens at the Olympics

Rugby Sevens made its Olympic debut at the Rio de Janeiro Games in 2016. The inclusion of Sevens in the Olympics was a major victory for World Rugby, the sport's governing body, which had lobbied for years to have rugby return to the Olympic fold. It was last an Olympic sport in the 1924 games, where the 15s version was played.

The inaugural Olympic Sevens tournament was considered successful, with Fiji's men's team winning their country's first-ever Olympic gold medal, and Australia's women's team taking home the gold in the women's competition. The spectacle of Sevens at the Olympics has helped introduce the sport to a broader audience.

In the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, held in 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Rugby Sevens again featured prominently. Fiji defended the men's title, while [New Zealand]({{< relref "teams/nzl" >}}) won the women's gold. In 2024 in Paris, France won the men's gold with New Zealand taking back-to-back women's gold medals.

## Which nations are the best?

Several countries have emerged as powerhouses in Rugby Sevens, consistently performing well in international competitions.

### [New Zealand]({{< relref "teams/nzl" >}})
Known as the **All Blacks Sevens**, New Zealand has a storied history in Rugby Sevens, winning multiple World Sevens Series titles and World Cup championships. 

### Fiji
Fiji's national Sevens team, known for its flamboyant style of play, is widely regarded as one of the best in the world. Fijian players are known for their incredible agility, offloading skills, and creativity, which have led them to win multiple World Sevens Series titles and back-to-back Olympic gold medals in 2016 and 2021.

### South Africa
The Blitzboks, South Africa's Sevens team, have also been a dominant force, winning several World Sevens Series titles. 

### Australia
Australia regularly feature in the top places at sevens events, having also won the World Series in 2021-22.

### England
Currently merged into Great Britain, England had a lot of success early in the 21st century featuring prominently as runners up several times. The top try scorer in the Sevens World Series is Englishman Dan Norton, who just pips Kenya's Collins Injera.

### United States
In recent years, the United States has made significant strides in Rugby Sevens, with the men's team regularly reaching the latter stages of the World Sevens Series and the women's team being highly competitive on the global stage.
