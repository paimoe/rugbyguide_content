# Rugby Newbie Guide

This repo contains the markdown files for the content of [The Rugby Guide](https://guide.rugbybot.com). The goal of the website is for people new to watching the game to have a dead simple explanation of the game. Details of the laws etc are further into the guide so people aren't scared away ðŸ˜„

Still a heavy work in progress.
